# Note on persistence: This is configured to create persistent data, which
# it will do in the /data directory on the container. If you want to use it
# in a way that persists data beyond the lifetime of the container, you 
# should attach a volume at /data. This file does not do so in favor of 
# doing it via docker-compose--please modify the docker-compose.yml file
# to adjust the storage, and make sure to either bring the container up 
# using `docker-compose`, or attach the volume explicitly via `--mount`
# flag to `docker run`.
